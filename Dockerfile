# 1. Build the portal micro-frontend (Vite + TS → portal/dist) in a node
#    stage. portal/ is a self-contained npm project so we only need its
#    package.json/lockfile + source — no host-side npm install required.

RUN npm install --no-audit --no-fund

RUN npm run build

# 2. Build the Go binary. assets.go embeds portal/dist via //go:embed, so
#    the dist/ output from the previous stage has to land at the right
#    relative path before `go build` runs.

# 3. Minimal runtime image. The portal assets are baked into the binary, so
#    there is nothing else to copy.
